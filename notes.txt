# Notes
- Solution: Token Ring
	- Each node will have a receive method
	- Each node will either use the token and execute the critical section of the code
	  or simply pass the token along.
	- During exectuion of critical section, the node simulates a that the execution
   	  takes a (little) time by sleeping and indication when it enters and exits the
	  section.

- Technical notes
	- The token is represented by a message	
	- During exectuion of critical section, the node simulates a that the execution
   	  takes a (little) time by sleeping and indication when it enters and exits the
	  section.
